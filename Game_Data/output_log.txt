Trying to load data from an older version of the A* Pathfinding Project
Current version: 3.8.8.1 Data version: 3.8.7
This is usually fine, it just means you have upgraded to a new version.
However node data (not settings) can get corrupted between versions (even though I try my best to keep compatibility), so it is recommended to recalculate any caches (those for faster startup) and resave any files. Even if it seems to load fine, it might cause subtle bugs.
